Sure! Hereâ€™s a detailed flow of your project along with a corresponding system diagram. This flow outlines the key steps involved in converting 8086 assembly code to machine code.

### Project Flow

1. **Input Assembly Code**:
   - Read assembly code from a file or user input.
   - Store the code in a suitable data structure (like an array or linked list).

2. **Parsing the Code**:
   - Tokenize the input into individual instructions using a parser.
   - Identify mnemonics, operands, labels, and comments.

3. **Symbol Table Creation**:
   - Create a symbol table to store labels and their corresponding addresses for easy reference.
   - If labels are found during parsing, add them to the symbol table.

4. **Opcode Lookup**:
   - For each parsed instruction, look up its corresponding opcode using a hash table or a predefined array.
   - Handle different addressing modes as necessary.

5. **Instruction Encoding**:
   - Encode the instruction into machine code format based on the identified opcode and operands.
   - Handle data types, immediate values, and addressing modes during this process.

6. **Output Machine Code**:
   - Store the resulting machine code in a suitable format (binary or hexadecimal).
   - Write the output to a file or display it to the user.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error checking for invalid instructions, undefined labels, and syntax errors.
   - Provide meaningful error messages to guide the user.

8. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test the converter with various assembly code snippets to ensure accuracy.
   - Validate outputs against expected machine code.

### Description of Each Component

1. **Input Assembly Code**: The entry point for the project, where the assembly code is received for processing.

2. **Parser**: This component takes the raw assembly code and breaks it down into manageable tokens, identifying mnemonics and operands.

3. **Symbol Table**: A structure that holds labels and their addresses, allowing for easy access when resolving references.

4. **Opcode Lookup**: A mechanism (like a hash table) that quickly finds the corresponding opcode for each mnemonic.

5. **Instruction Encoding**: The process of converting parsed instructions into machine code, taking into account various factors like addressing modes and data types.

6. **Output Machine Code**: The final stage where the generated machine code is outputted to the user or saved to a file.

7. **Error Handling**: A crucial aspect of the program that checks for common issues and provides feedback to the user.

8. **Testing & Validation**: Ensures that the converter works correctly by comparing outputs with expected results.

### Summary

This flow and diagram provide a clear roadmap for your project, helping you stay organized and focused as you develop your assembly to machine code converter. Each component is interconnected, creating a structured approach to tackle the problem effectively.
