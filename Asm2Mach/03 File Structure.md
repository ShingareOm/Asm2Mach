Creating a well-organized project directory structure is crucial for maintaining clarity and ease of navigation. Here’s a suggested directory flow for your 8086 assembly to machine code converter project:

### Project Directory Structure

```

├── /src                  # Source files
│   ├── main.c           # Main program file
│   ├── parser.c         # Functions for parsing assembly code
│   ├── opcode_lookup.c   # Functions for opcode lookup
│   ├── instruction.c     # Functions for encoding instructions

│   └── developer_guide.md  # Developer guide for contributing
│
├── /build                # Compiled binaries and intermediate files
│   └── converter         # Compiled executable file

```

### Directory Breakdown

1. **`/src`**: Contains all source code files. Each file is responsible for specific functionalities, keeping the code modular and organized.

2. **`/include`**: Contains header files that declare the functions used in the source files. This structure facilitates easier management of function declarations.

3. **`/data`**: Holds sample assembly code files for testing and validation purposes, including expected outputs and error cases.

4. **`/tests`**: Contains unit tests for various components of the converter. This directory can include automated test scripts to verify the correctness of your implementation.

5. **`/docs`**: Holds documentation files, providing details about the project, user instructions, and developer guidelines.

6. **`/build`**: A place for compiled binaries and intermediate files. This keeps the root directory clean and separates source code from build artifacts.

7. **`Makefile`**: A file that defines the build process. It specifies how to compile the source code and can automate tasks like cleaning up build artifacts.

8. **`README.md`**: A markdown file that gives an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage examples, and any other relevant information.

### Benefits of This Structure

- **Clarity**: Each component of the project is organized logically, making it easy to find files and understand the project's layout.
- **Modularity**: Keeping functionality in separate files allows for easier updates and maintenance.
- **Testing**: Having a dedicated tests directory encourages regular testing and validation of your code.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation ensures that others (or you in the future) can understand and use the project effectively.

This directory structure provides a solid foundation for your project, allowing you to focus on development while maintaining organization.
