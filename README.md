# Asm2Mach: Assembly to Machine Code Converter

## Overview
Asm2Mach is a simple yet powerful converter that translates 8086 assembly language code into machine code. This project aims to help users understand the fundamentals of assembly language and machine code representation, making it a valuable tool for learning and experimentation.

## Features
- Parse 8086 assembly instructions.
- Convert mnemonics to corresponding machine code.
- Support for multiple operands and addressing modes.
- Error handling for invalid instructions and undefined labels.
- Output machine code in hexadecimal or binary format.

```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Asm2Mach
   ```
3. Build the project using the Makefile:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your assembly code in a file (e.g., `sample.asm`) within the `data` directory.
2. Run the converter with the following command:
   ```bash
   ./build/converter data/sample.asm
   ```
3. The output machine code will be displayed in the console or saved to an output file, depending on the implementation.

## Testing
Unit tests are included in the `tests` directory. To run the tests, ensure you have built the project first, then execute the test files using your preferred testing framework.

## Error Handling
The converter includes error checking to ensure valid input. Common errors include:
- Invalid mnemonics.
- Undefined labels.
- Syntax errors in assembly instructions.
